# Capstone Project 2: Congressional Survival

## Problem
Based on their voting history, what type of congress member is most likely to survive in what political environment? 
Election results are highly dependent on voter enthusiasm, partisanlean, and the national political environment.  However, when voting on legislation, members of congress in swing districts must do a cost benefit analysis of meeting the partisan preferences of their district or the expectations of their own base. What type of strategy most successfully predicts survival?

## Client / Stakeholder case:
This information could be useful for any number of congressional members for determining their voting choices, or for National level party organs such as the Democratic National Commitee, to pass along to their candidates. 

## Data Sets
The primary dataset is congressional voting records going back to 1981 available from the House and Senate clerk offices via the [ProPublica Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/).
